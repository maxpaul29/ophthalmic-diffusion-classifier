# Ophthalmic Diffusion Classifier — `drusen-mogon` branch

**Author:** Maximilian Paul · **Institution:** Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz · **Context:** Bachelor's thesis — *Exploring Generative AI Models for Ophthalmic Disease Classification*

This is **not** the main branch for this thesis. It contains only the Phase-1 stage of the pipeline: large-scale, unconditioned pretraining of the diffusion model on public fundus images, run on the MOGON HPC cluster (SLURM, no Docker, Python 3.12.3). Its output (a pretrained checkpoint) is the starting point for Phase 2 — fine-tuning on the private clinical Drusen dataset, cross-validation, the ResNet50 baseline, and the uncertainty analysis — all of which live on the **`drusen`** branch instead.

**For the full change history of both branches, see `CHANGELOG.md` on the `drusen` branch** — it documents this branch's modifications (Section 2, "MOGON HPC Branch") alongside the Clinical PC ones, plus the rationale for splitting the work across two branches (Section 5). This branch only carries its own `dataset/splits/SPLITS.md` and `results/RESULTS.md`, describing the pretraining-specific splits and results.

## Requirements

* Use Linux (recommended) for best performance, compatibility, and reproducibility.
* All testing, training, inference completed with A100 NVIDIA GPUs (single or multiple).
* 64-bit Python 3.10 and PyTorch 2.6. See https://pytorch.org for PyTorch install instructions.
* Python virtual environment (recommended) to manage libraries, packages for this repository.

## Getting Started

First, clone this repository.

### Installing Packages

Required packages are provided in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

FlashAttention can be installed for faster inference time (especially for DiT models). The wheel file can be downloaded from [FlashAttention GitHub](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/tag/v2.7.4.post1). We used `flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl` for our CUDA and Torch version. After downloading the wheel file, install it with:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.7.4.post1/flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl

pip install flash_attn-2.7.4.post1+cu12torch2.6cxx11abiFALSE-cp310-cp310-linux_x86_64.whl
```

### Data Preparation

We use the CheXpert and ISIC datasets in our paper. Our train/validation/test CSV files for both datasets are in the `splits` folder.

### Downloading Model Weights

All trained models can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x7CKrbS8pxS45EXzpUKhpusBYCLgH82Y?usp=drive_link). Alternatively, use the following command with `gdown`:

```bash
gdown --folder 1x7CKrbS8pxS45EXzpUKhpusBYCLgH82Y
```

### Configuration

Before using the models, modify the `scripts/run.sh` file:

- `PROJECT_ROOT`: Absolute path to the root directory of the diffusion-classifier repository.
- `DATA_ROOT`: Absolute path to the data directory containing `isic_mel_balanced/`, `chexpert/`, and `sd_isic_chexpert/` folders.
- `INFERENCE_CHECKPOINT_FOLDER`: Absolute path to the directory where the downloaded model weights are stored.

If you want to use CometML for experiment tracking, set the COMET variables in `run.sh`. Additionally, you must set `USE_COMET=1` to enable tracking.

All training/inference hyperparameters are defined in their corresponding bash scripts. For example, the CheXpert-UNet hyperparameters are specified in `scripts/unet/chexpert-unet.sh`.

Below, we describe various use cases that are easily achievable with simple customizations to our code. In any case, launching the desired experiment is done via `bash scripts/run.sh` from the parent folder of the repository.

## Using Pre-Trained Models

Scripts to run inference with all models are provided in the `scripts` folder. However to launch each script you only have to modify the `run.sh` file to select which model and data you want to run. For instance, to run the UNet model's inference on the CheXpert dataset, you'll need to set `MODEL=unet`, `DATA=chexpert`, `FUNCTION=inference`. 

### Baselines

Baseline classifiers for both datasets can be evaluated using scripts in `scripts/run.sh`. You can change the `VARIANT` and `BACKBONE` environment variables to run different models. Available models:

| VARIANT                              | BACKBONE     |
|--------------------------------------|--------------|
| resnet18                             | resnet       |
| resnet50                             | resnet       |
| efficientnet_b0                      | efficientnet |
| efficientnet_b4                      | efficientnet |
| swin_base_patch4_window7_224         | swin         |
| vit_base_patch16_224                 | vit          |
| vit_small_patch16_224                | vit          |

To evaluate on CheXpert, modify the `run.sh` file:

```bash
export MODEL="baseline" 
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

Or on ISIC:

```bash
export MODEL="baseline"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

### Inference: Diffusion Models

Use the following instructions to run inference with diffusion models.

For faster inference, set the `FLASH_ATTENTION` variable to `true` for DiT and UNet models.

**CheXpert-UNet:**
```bash
export MODEL="unet"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

**ISIC-UNet:**
```bash
export MODEL="unet"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="isic" 
```

**CheXpert-DiT:**
```bash
export MODEL="dit"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

**ISIC-DiT:**
```bash
export MODEL="dit"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="isic" 
```

**CheXpert-StableDiffusion:**
```bash
export MODEL="sd"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

**ISIC-StableDiffusion:**
```bash
export MODEL="sd"
export FUNCTION="inference"
export DATA="dit" 
```

### Counterfactual Generation

Counterfactual generation is currently supported only for UNet models. To generate counterfactuals for the UNet models, modify the script to run `explain.py` instead of `inference.py`. This can be easily done by changing the `FUNCTION` value to `explain`:

```bash
export MODEL="unet"
export FUNCTION="explain"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

To improve visual quality, increase `SAMPLING_STEPS` to at least 256 in the unet scripts (`scripts/unet/chexpert-unet.sh` and `scripts/unet/isic-unet.sh`). `CFG_W` refers to the classifier-free guidance scale.

The images will be saved in the `inference_images` directory located within the experiment folder.

## Training Models

Similar to counterfactual generation, training different models is as simple as changing the `FUNCTION` to `train`. For example, to train the UNet model on CheXpert data you should use the following environment variables:

```
export MODEL="unet"
export FUNCTION="train"
export DATA="chexpert" 
```

**Note:** The Stable Diffusion model is jointly trained on both ISIC and CheXpert datasets. To train on a single dataset, modify the `metadata.jsonl` placed in `data/sd_isic_chexpert` file and adjust the training data folder accordingly.

In order to train the Stable Diffusion model, the diffusers package should be installed [from source](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/installation#install-from-source). To do this you can run the following command:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers
```

The output directory for the Stable Diffusion model can be set in its `train.sh` script, while other models will save their checkpoints within their respective experiment folders.
